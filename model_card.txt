# {model_name} - JAX/Flax

This repository contains the JAX/Flax version of the {model_name} model, originally a PyTorch model from {original_model_org}. This conversion enables efficient inference and training on TPUs and GPUs using the JAX/Flax framework.

## Model Description

{model_name} is a transformer-based language model developed by {original_model_org}. 

## Conversion Details

This model was converted from the original PyTorch implementation to JAX/Flax. The conversion process involved the following steps:

1. **Loading the PyTorch model and configuration:** The pretrained PyTorch model and its configuration were loaded using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
2. **Creating an equivalent Flax model architecture:** A Flax model with the same architecture as the original PyTorch model was created.
3. **Converting the PyTorch weights to Flax format:** The weights from the PyTorch model were converted to the Flax format using the `convert_pytorch_state_dict_to_flax` utility function provided by Hugging Face.
4. **Verifying the converted weights:** The converted Flax weights were compared against the original PyTorch weights to ensure that the conversion process was performed accurately.

### Important Note about `max_position_embeddings`

During the conversion process, it was necessary to modify the `max_position_embeddings` parameter in the model's configuration. The original value of {{original_max_pos_embed}} led to out-of-memory (OOM) errors on the hardware used for conversion. To resolve this, `max_position_embeddings` was adjusted to {{new_max_pos_embed}}.

**Implications of this change:**

*   The model may not be able to handle sequences longer than {new_max_pos_embed} tokens without truncation or other modifications.
*   If you fine-tune this model, keep in mind the revised `max_position_embeddings` when preparing your training data.

## Weight Comparison

The following table summarizes the comparison between the weights of the original PyTorch model and the converted JAX/Flax model. This detailed verification confirms that the conversion was accurate and that both models should produce (approximately) the same outputs given the same inputs.

**Note:**

*   `Allclose` indicates whether the weights are approximately equal within the specified relative (`rtol=1e-5`) and absolute (`atol=1e-3`) tolerances using `jnp.allclose()`.
*   `Max Diff`, `Mean Diff`, and `Std Diff` provide further details on the differences between the weights if `Allclose` is `False`, which might be expected for some layers due to numerical precision differences between frameworks.

## Hardware Used for Conversion

The conversion process was performed on the following hardware configuration:

{hardware_info}

This conversion took approximately {conversion_time} to complete.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the converted model in JAX/Flax for text generation:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from transformers import FlaxAutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "{repo_name}"  # Replace with your repository name
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = FlaxAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, from_pt=False) # from_pt should be False since it's already flax

# Example prompt
prompt = "The quick brown fox"

# Tokenize the prompt
tokenized_prompt = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="np")

# Generate text
output_ids = model.generate(tokenized_prompt.input_ids, max_length=50)

# Decode the generated text
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
## Limitations

Sequence Length: As mentioned earlier, the max_position_embeddings has been modified to {new_max_pos_embed}. Be mindful of this limitation when working with long sequences.

Numerical Precision: Minor differences in outputs compared to the original PyTorch model might be observed due to numerical precision variations between PyTorch and JAX/Flax, particularly on different hardware.
